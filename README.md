  The project involves multiple components, primarily in MatLab, VHDL, and Linux environments, with significant use of tools like CoCoTb and vUnit for testing and verification.

    The MatLab section includes code for comparison in Octave, facilitated by Python.
    The Linux section focuses on VHDL code for a virtual machine, divided into various phases such as initial contact with VHDL, PRBS design, and test bench development.
    A significant part of the project is a course assignment, where a DVB-T channel estimator is developed in VHDL and verified using CoCoTb.
    The report consists of detailed documentation in MATLAB and VHDL.

The project structure emphasizes simulation and testing frameworks, particularly within a VHDL context.
